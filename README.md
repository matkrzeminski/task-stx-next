This repo contains a task that I have been given by a company to assess my python/django skills. <br>
## Objective
The objective of the task was to create a book management application that would allow users to add, edit, and delete 
books. As well as import them from the Google Books API.<br>
It should also have a filter functionality with which users could filter the books by title, author, publication 
language or publication date. <br>
Application should provide a listing of books in a form of an API that also supports filtering and have unit tests.
